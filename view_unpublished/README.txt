Description:
------------
This module allows you to grant access for users to see unpublished nodes.

Usage:
------
view_unpublished looks for the "view all unpublished content" permission and then the "view unpublished (node type) content" permission when a user tries to view a node that is unpublished.

After installing the module, navigate to your user access page and assign the appropriate permissions to the roles you wish to be able to view unpublished nodes.
